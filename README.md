# Data Science Projects
These projects are part of the [DataCamp - Data Science Curse](http://datacamp.com) 

#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is demostrate skills and be confident with my knowledge. 

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas 
* Jupyter
* sklearn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* etc. 

## Project Description
We'll demostrate how Python allow us to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize dataâ€”all integral skills for research. Through these projects, we'll get hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more. We'll then work with datasets to perform the statistical and machine learning techniques we need to train Machine learning. 

## Needs of this project

- data scientist and researchers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- store telling
