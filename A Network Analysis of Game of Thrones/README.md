# Project Description
Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister? Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? 
Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this!
In this project, we will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books 
in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). 
We will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.
